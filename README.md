# Shopping Calculator

Welcome to our Capstone Project.

This project originally started as a basic calculator but has since become a shopping calculator.

Our shopping calculator takes into account a sale %, item quantity, and state sales tax.

The idea is to make it easier to calculate what you actually save when you are shopping.

Additionally we help you calculate sales tax so you can be sure of what you are paying before checking out.

## Ruby

Our project is done entrirely in Ruby. If you do not have Ruby on your system it can be downloaded [here](https://ruby-doc.org/downloads/).

Additionally, we use Ruby2d to create our GUI. If you already have Ruby, Ruby2d can be installed using

`gem install ruby2d`

More information about installing Ruby2d can be found [here](https://www.ruby2d.com/learn/get-started/).
